# Introduction to AI and Machine Learning on Google Cloud
## Introduction
The notes of this module will generally have these three keywords after each lesson, module, lab etc.
- `Keyword 1` Points I learned in this module
- `Keyword 2` Use cases to apply what I learned in the module
- `Keyword 3` New bussiness ideas that can be generated using the tech in this module

As we all know that AI is making a huge impact in everybodies lives and this is just the starting of **General Purpose Technologies (GPT's)**. The training data and the computing power is increasing day by day and we are heading to more and more complex models.
This course will give the understanding of emearging technical skills to make your place in the AI world.

### AI Foundations
- **Why AI** \
Let's say there is a company called `Coffee On Wheels` and it is facing the following problems
  - Specific places to sell their product and routing problems.
  - Sales Forecasting and real-time monitoring of sales.
  - Marketing Campaign Automations.

To solve these potential issues Coffee on Wheels reaches out to `DataBeans`, an AI powered company that uses BigQuery, Gemini and Vertex AI to make marketing campaigns, Sales forecasting and much more stuff.\
Now Coffee on Wheels is able to get through their potential issues that they were facing.\
  -  By leveraging the application, Coffee on Wheels gained the following benefits:
  
    * Streamlined business processes in key areas such as marketing, digital commerce, and back-office operations.
    * Modernized customer service through features such as automated comment replies and actionable consumer insights and predictions.
    * Enhanced employee productivity through the utilization of GenAI for code assistance and marketing content generation.


- **AI/ML Architecture**\
Data is the basis of AI. Google has been working and making innovations on AI/ML since a long time.
Some of the key innovations of google includes:
    - **BigQuery** : A data warehouse widely used on Google Cloud, can analyze large amounts of data and build ML models at the same time with SQL, Structured Query Language.
    - In 2015, **Pub/Sub** was invented to help build data pipelines for streaming analytics.
    - The widely-used ML library in Python for general purposes **scikit-learn** was a Google summer coding project back in 2007.
    - **TensorFlow**, an open-source ML platform for training deep learning neural networks was developed by Google in 2015.
    - **The transformer**, the basis of all generative AI (or gen AI) applications seen today, was invented by Google in 2017.
    - From this, large language models evolved rapidly, including **Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)** in 2018, Language Model for Dialogue Applications (LaMDA) in 2021, Pathways Language Model (PaLM).
    - **Gemini**, the most recent cutting-edge genAI model to process multimodal data released at the end of 2023.
    - In 2023, Google also announced a series of generative AI products on **Vertex AI** such as **Vertex AI Studio, Model Garden, and Search and Conversation**.
